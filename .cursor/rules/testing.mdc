1. **Keep tests very minimal and focused** - Avoid over-testing
2. **Combine related assertions** in the same test when logical
3. **Remove redundant or overly granular tests**
4. **Focus on critical functionality** - Test edge cases and integration points rather than every possible variation
5. **Assert actual values** - instad of approximations like is close to etc, run some dummy tests to actually capture the outputs, and use them as exact asserts
